MEG data

MEG data were collected during resting state, a sensorimotor task, and an audio-visual (passive)

T1 and T2 weighted MRI

Gathered at a single site
306 sensor (102 magnetometer and 204 planer gradiometer)
light magnetically shilded room

fs = 1000 hz
high pass filter (cutoff 0.03)

other signals:    
    - Head-position Indicator (HPI)
    - one vertical and one horizontal EOG
    - ECG


eyes closed

signal duration: 8min and 40s

preprocessing:
    temporal signal space seperation (tSSS) ==> removing noise including external and HPI coils noise (correlation threshold 0.98, 10-sec sliding window)
    head motion corection
    maxwell filter (notchfilter(50Hz) and automatically detect and virtually reconstruct any noisy channels)
    transformed into a common head position
    ICA (those ICs that had the highest correlation with ECG, VEOG and HOG were projected out ==> Therefore, 3 ICs were projected out)


numbers of participants per seven decades from 18 to 87, respectively: 47, 102, 100, 97, 94, 93, 90 (Notice that these are those participants that had both resting and task MEG)
