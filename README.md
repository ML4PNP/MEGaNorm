  Normative modeling of EEG/MEG brain dynamics across populations and timescales.
</p>


**MEGaNorm** is a Python toolbox for extracting functional imaging-derived phenotypes (f-IDPs) from large-scale EEG and MEG datasets, before normative modeling. It allows researchers to build, visualize, and analyze normative models of brain dynamics across individuals.

## üì¶ Installation

### Option 1: Using Conda + Pip

We recommend using a clean conda environment:

```bash
# 1. Create and activate environment
conda create --channel=conda-forge --strict-channel-priority --name mne python=3.12 mne
conda activate mne

# 2. Clone and install MEGaNorm
git clone https://github.com/ML4PNP/MEGaNorm.git
cd MEGaNorm/
pip install .
```

---

### Option 2: Using Docker

We provide a pre-configured Docker environment with Jupyter Lab. You can either **build the image locally** or **pull the latest version from Docker Hub**.

#### Option A: Build the image locally

```bash
make build
make run
```

#### Option B: Pull the latest image from Docker Hub

```bash
make pull
make run
```

This mounts:

* `notebooks/` ‚Üí for saving Jupyter notebooks
* `results/` ‚Üí for analysis outputs
* `data/` ‚Üí for raw/processed EEG/MEG data

Jupyter will open in your browser on [http://localhost:8888](http://localhost:8888)
