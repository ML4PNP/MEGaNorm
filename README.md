## üì¶ Installation

### Option 1: Using Conda + Pip

We recommend using a clean conda environment:

```bash
# 1. Create and activate environment
conda create --channel=conda-forge --strict-channel-priority --name mne python=3.12 mne
conda activate mne

# 2. Clone and install MEGaNorm
git clone https://github.com/ML4PNP/MEGaNorm.git
cd MEGaNorm/
pip install .
```

### Option 2: Using Docker

We provide a pre-configured Docker environment with Jupyter Lab:

```bash
# Build the image
make build

# Run with Jupyter Lab and mounted folders
make run
```

This mounts:

* `notebooks/` ‚Üí for saving Jupyter notebooks
* `results/` ‚Üí for analysis outputs
* `data/` ‚Üí for raw/processed EEG/MEG data

Jupyter will open in your browser on [http://localhost:8888](http://localhost:8888)
