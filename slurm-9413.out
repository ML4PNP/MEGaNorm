/home/zamanzad/trial1/fooofAnalysis.py:5: DeprecationWarning: 
The `fooof` package is being deprecated and replaced by the `specparam` (spectral parameterization) package.
This version of `fooof` (1.1) is fully functional, but will not be further updated.
New projects are recommended to update to using `specparam` (see Changelog for details).
